    "text": "Start with the Audience\nWhen I attended MICA, whenever we would be instructed to work on a data visualization assignment, the first thing that we’d promoted to do was to think and ask “who is your audience” The audience paints the narrative. I started my data visualization career while working at a non-profit that was always careful about what was communicated. As I continued to advance in my data viz career, I saw the evolution in just how important data visualization and information design professionals are.\nThis past summer, I had the opportunity to join Enrico Bertini’s inaugural Rhetorical Visualization course. Over five weeks, our cohort explored the theory and practice of creating visualizations that don’t just inform but resonate with their intended audience. Through weekly discussions, hands-on exercises, and thought-provoking lessons, we unpacked the nuances of how visualizations convey messages and shape interpretations.\nRhetorical visualization goes beyond aesthetics or clarity—it’s about the messaging. As Enrico puts it, it examines “the role in the messages a visualization conveys and the inferences one can make.” This idea—how our design decisions influence audience understanding—was a recurring theme throughout the course and challenged me to think more critically about my work.\nOne of the most impactful lessons for me was the concept of framing. As Enrico emphasized, data doesn’t speak for itself. This might sound surprising, especially since many of us have heard the phrase tossed around casually in workplaces or even in the media. But the act of visualizing data—choosing what to include, exclude, and how to present it—inevitably shapes a narrative. This realization was both humbling and empowering. Framing taught me that no visualization is ever completely neutral. Every chart carries the weight of its creator’s decisions, from the scale of the axes to the title we give it. Even something as seemingly straightforward as a bar chart can convey vastly different messages depending on these choices. This pushed me to think critically about my own work: What narrative am I shaping? And is it aligned with the truth I want to convey?\nThese lessons hit home when thinking about high-stakes visualizations—charts about climate change, election results, or pandemics like COVID-19. In these scenarios, where misinformation can have far-reaching consequences, rhetorical visualization becomes a critical skill. It’s not just about making data clear; it’s about ensuring it’s truthful and responsibly framed.\nEnrico’s course was, at its core, a call to action: to create data visualizations with integrity and to develop the habit of scrutinizing our work and that of others. As practitioners, we hold immense responsibility in shaping how people interpret data. This course sharpened my ability to reason with data effectively and reinforced the idea that there is always a frame—whether we acknowledge it or not.\nTaking this course felt like an exercise in due diligence for any data visualization professional—a deep dive into the ethics of our work. It was a reminder that every decision we make, from data collection to visual design, carries weight. By applying the principles of rhetorical visualization, we can create visuals that don’t just inform but resonate with integrity and purpose."

    "text": "Wrangling the Data\nAt the end of each quarter, I’d reach out to various departments to gather updates on programs and activities. As the Data Insights Specialist II, I stayed informed on organizational activities year-round, as our team was heavily involved in evaluations and research. Proactively engaging with pilots, program performance, evaluations, research, and analyses allowed me to know exactly what to ask for when compiling the board report, ensuring relevant insights were included.\nThe Data\nUsually, these updates came back to me as rudimentary figures, spreadsheets, or dashboards from which I’d pull data points. I would then download these into .csv files and process them using my favorite tool: pandas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Via G-chat: Quick messages containing key data points or updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Through Google Sheets: More structured data in spreadsheets shared across departments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Inside Emails: Often, data came embedded within the text of an email, requiring careful extraction and verification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Data Sharing Methods Across Departments; Illustrations by Kristin Sandgren-Jolain\n\n\n\nIn addition to incorporating relevant program updates, we also included findings from the Learning and Impact team’s internal analyses. One quarter, we included insights derived from an evaluation of one of our intervention methods. These insights revealed specific characteristics and intervention dosages that significantly increased the likelihood of success for our participants.\n“Likelihood”—there’s a term you’ll often hear in data science. Within the Learning and Impact team and in discussions across departments, terms like probabilities and likelihoods were straightforward to discuss, thanks to the context we could provide. However, translating these and other statistical terms accurately into language and visuals for the board—without the benefit of interactive dialogue—posed a unique challenge.\nIn the code blocks that follow, which I’ve anonymized for confidentiality, I’ll briefly demonstrate how I transformed data into visuals for our board updates. The data cleaning, processing, and manipulation steps shown below are routine practices I used to prepare the data points received from various departments. These steps were crucial for converting raw data, whether received through G-chat, Google Sheets, or emails, into clear, impactful board-level visual presentations.\n\n# Setting Up Environment\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n# Read in Data\ndf1 = pd.read_csv(\"anonymized_all.csv\")\ndf2 = pd.read_csv(\"anonymized_fy24_only.csv\")\n\n\n# First few rows of raw data\ndf1.head()\ndf2.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique Identifier\nStart Date\nClient Name\nJob ID\n\n\n\n\n0\n581013\n9/25/23\n581013 Record\njob-193451\n\n\n1\n583586\n7/17/23\n583586 Record\njob-198299\n\n\n2\n585047\n7/11/23\n585047 Record\njob-198331\n\n\n3\n576444\n7/9/23\n576444 Record\njob-198365\n\n\n4\n585401\n9/18/23\n585401 Record\njob-198436\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Cleaning and transforming the data\ndef clean_df(df, date_col, drop_col):\n    df[date_col] = pd.to_datetime(df[date_col])\n    df = df.drop([drop_col], axis = 1) # Drops Unnecessary Columns\n    df.columns = df.columns.str.lower() # Standardize Column Names\n    \n    return df\n\ncleaned_df1 = clean_df(df1,'Start Date', 'Client Name')\ncleaned_df2 = clean_df(df2,'Start Date', 'Client Name')\n\n\ndef fiscal_year(date): # Fiscal Year Calculation\n    if date.month &gt;=7:\n        return date.year + 1\n    else:\n        return date.year\n    \ncleaned_df1['fiscal year'] = cleaned_df1['start date'].apply(fiscal_year)\ncleaned_df2['fiscal year'] = cleaned_df2['start date'].apply(fiscal_year)\n\n\n# Check FYs in dataset\ncleaned_df1['fiscal year'].unique()\n\narray([2021, 2022, 2023, 2024])\n\n\n\ncleaned_previous = cleaned_df1[cleaned_df1['fiscal year'].isin([2024])]\n# cleaned_previous.head()\n\n\nprevious_weekly_performance = (\n  cleaned_previous\n  .groupby(['fiscal year', pd.Grouper(key='start date', freq='W')]).size()\n  .reset_index(name = 'previous_weekly_performance')\n)\n# previous_weekly_performance\n\n\nprevious_weekly_performance['cumulative_performance'] = (\n  previous_weekly_performance\n  .groupby('fiscal year')['previous_weekly_performance']\n  .cumsum()\n)\nprevious_weekly_performance.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfiscal year\nstart date\nprevious_weekly_performance\ncumulative_performance\n\n\n\n\n0\n2024\n2023-07-02\n15\n15\n\n\n1\n2024\n2023-07-09\n77\n92\n\n\n2\n2024\n2023-07-16\n99\n191\n\n\n3\n2024\n2023-07-23\n71\n262\n\n\n4\n2024\n2023-07-30\n72\n334\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncurrent_weekly_performance = (\n  cleaned_df2\n  .groupby(['fiscal year', pd.Grouper(key='start date', freq='W')]).size()\n  .reset_index(name = 'current_weekly_performance')\n)\ncurrent_weekly_performance['current_cumulative_performance']= (\n  current_weekly_performance\n  .groupby('fiscal year')['current_weekly_performance']\n  .cumsum()\n)\n# current_weekly_performance.head()\n\n\nmerged_df = pd.merge(previous_weekly_performance, current_weekly_performance, how = 'outer')\n# merged_df.head()"

    "text": "Designing Clear Visuals\nAfter extensive data manipulation—cleaning, pivoting, and generating initial visuals like bar charts—I begin to see potential ways to make the data understandable for the board.\nFor the quarterly board presentation that used the anonymized code blocks introduced earlier, I constructed the two charts below using the resulting merged_df. Given the available variables, focusing on temporal dynamics and comparative metrics provides a valuable direction to uncover significant trends and irregularities to highlight in the final product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The bar chart shows weekly performance trends for previous and current periods, highlighting fluctuations and potential seasonal patterns. This dense representation helps identify key variations but can be visually complex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The line chart offers a clearer view of performance over time by smoothing out weekly noise and emphasizing long-term trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Initial stages of the data visualization workflow, creating basic plots to explore and refine key trends\n\n\n\nSource: 1-intervention-analysis.ipynb\nNow, with some initial visualizations created, I can focus on refining and enhancing the clarity of the data presentation and insight delivery. One best practice I adhere to in my visualization work is the “30-second rule” (sometimes it’s more like 2 minutes). The idea is that viewers should quickly grasp the intent of a chart or graph. This contrasts with the more abstract visualizations by my favoured artists like Federica Fragipane and Alberto Cairo, who target a different audience.\nFor board presentations, I prioritize straightforward designs and avoid overly complex or abstract visuals. Sketching with pencil and paper after extensive screen time helps me push the boundaries of basic charts just enough to enhance clarity without becoming too abstract. This physical connection with my work makes the creative process more tangible and refreshing. It allows me to identify where strategic annotations, adjustments to bar charts, or repositioning elements in a scatterplot can significantly improve the visual clarity and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSketch 1: An early concept for communicating demographic breakdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSketch 2: A rough layout; I use simple lines and directional arrows to indicate movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSketch 3: When clarity and speed are key, humbling myself to use versatile bar charts is best.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these principles in mind I refine and enhance the clarity of the data presentation to produce final visuals."

    "text": "For project 2 we were instructed to “stretch our skills a little bit more”. For each project we’re allowed only 2 weeks to complete. In these past 2 weeks we’ve learned scraping, ai2html, a little D3 on top of pandas, Altair, elements of visual design and storytelling. Unfortunately, I was not able to turn my project around by the two week deadline. Though I definitely did improve from the previous project- which I completed in 3 days. Despite being more prepared I faced several roadblocks. Ai2html wouldn’t work, the svg I used as a base to work off from took a little longer to re-illustrate, and I forgot I didn’t actually know CSS that would help bring the story to life (for Project 1 I used a combination of borrowing from previous students and ChatGPT). So instead, here’s this painstaking review -a postmortem- of my process (including when I hit a wall) of Project 2."

    "text": "The Idea\nWith only 2 weeks, determined not to spend too much time in the data collection phase but knowing I wanted to specifically put my scraping skills to the test, I resolved that scraping data from Zillow would be challenging enough. The discussion about rent in NYC is a topic of importance to me. But I wanted to do something a little different than what’s been discussed ad nauseam (include link about high rent in NYC). I thought about what’s important to me when it comes to looking for a place to live but is usually inaccessible or would put me in a rental bracket that’s higher than I can afford. Alas, sunlight. If you scroll through Facebook groups and craigslist posts for the apartment hopper, posts almost always (though not always the case) start with “Bright”, “North-facing” (to imply gets a lot of sunlight) or “Sunny”."

    "text": "Getting the Data and Narrowing the Scope\nWith a rough idea in mind, I took to researching how exactly one could calculate or guesstimate how much sunlight an apartment would get. To my luck, the real estate company Localize.city had just what I needed. Data scientists working with the company just as aware of the value of apartment sun exposure as I was, using a combination of GIS, 3D analysis and a python library called PySolar developed an algorithm which allows them to advertise the degree of sun exposure apartments listed on their website get. I attended mentorship with Kai Teoh with what I’d found, with the intention to scrape Localize.city’s webpage. However, the site has rate blocking which quickly detects if someone (like a student practicing scraping) is scraping their website. Kai had a solution. He gave me an introduction to accessing undocumented api’s using cUrl and sent me off to test it. While I was a little disappointed that I would not get to put my new scraping skills to use I was relieved I could rely on my API skills gained 2 weeks prior and get ahead in my data processing. But I was unsuccessful and after a second check-in with Kai, we realized we definitely could not make calls to the api. Instead I would have to copy the XHR api feed for each search result page into a text file (I used Sublime) and save it as a json.\n\nWith only 1 ½ week left and determined not to relive Project 1’s experience, I started cutting, no, slashing the fat.\nInstead of all of NYC -&gt; Brookyln\nInstead of all of Brooklyn -&gt; Prospect Park (an area quadrangled by contrasting wealth groups).\nInstead of all apartment types -&gt; only those of a certain size\n\nThe resulting 13 pages weren’t ideal but were hopefully enough to tell a story or delivery insights about the relationship between sun exposure and rental prices."
